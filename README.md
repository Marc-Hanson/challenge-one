## Features

The game was styled with a feeling for the wild west and gambling in an old timey saloon. The fonts chosen: 'Rye' and 'Smokum' both push that theme as well as a sunset color palette of yellows, oranges and browns.

### Existing Features

- **The Heading**

  - Featured at the top of the page, the heading is used to welcome the user to the page. Once the dice have been rolled the heading will display the winner or loser of the game.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
